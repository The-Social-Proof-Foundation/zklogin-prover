# Railway Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

1. A Railway account (https://railway.app)
2. Railway CLI installed (optional)
3. GitHub repository with the zkLogin Proving Service code

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare the Repository

Ensure your repository includes:
- All source files (circuits, server.js, etc.)
- `Dockerfile` for building the container
- `railway.toml` configuration file
- `package.json` with dependencies

### 2. Deploy via Railway Dashboard

1. Log in to Railway Dashboard
2. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your repository
4. Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile
5. Wait for the build to complete (may take 5-10 minutes due to rapidsnark compilation)

### 3. Environment Variables (if needed)

Set the following in Railway's environment variables:
- `PORT` - Railway will provide this automatically
- Any other custom variables your service needs

### 4. Verify Deployment

Once deployed, Railway will provide a URL like:
```
https://your-service.railway.app
```

Test the endpoints:
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-service.railway.app/health

# Service info
curl https://your-service.railway.app/

# Generate proof
curl -X POST https://your-service.railway.app/prove \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jwtHash": "14744269619966411208579211824598458697587494354926760081771325075741142829156",
    "nonce": "0",
    "pubKeyHash": "0"
  }'
```

## Important Notes

1. **Build Time**: The first deployment will take longer due to:
   - Installing build dependencies
   - Compiling rapidsnark from source
   - Building the Docker image

2. **Binary Compatibility**: The Dockerfile builds rapidsnark for Linux, ensuring compatibility with Railway's runtime environment.

3. **Resource Usage**: 
   - Proof generation is CPU-intensive
   - Consider Railway's resource limits for production use
   - Monitor usage and scale as needed

4. **Security**:
   - This is a demonstration implementation
   - For production, implement proper authentication
   - Consider rate limiting for the `/prove` endpoint

## Troubleshooting

1. **Build Failures**: Check Railway logs for compilation errors
2. **Runtime Errors**: Ensure all files are included in the Docker image
3. **Proof Generation Fails**: Verify circuit files and keys are properly copied

## Alternative Deployment

If you prefer to deploy a pre-built image:

1. Build locally:
```bash
docker build -t zklogin-prover .
```

2. Push to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub):
```bash
docker tag zklogin-prover yourusername/zklogin-prover
docker push yourusername/zklogin-prover
```

3. Deploy from Docker image in Railway
